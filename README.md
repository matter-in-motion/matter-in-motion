# Matter In Motion

## Micro service framework and protocol with the focus on real-time applications, blazing response time and low memory footprint.

## Why not REST?

To put it simple real world application needs more than GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Real world applications use more than just HTTP. How about WebSockets? MQTT? Events? Notifications?

### Features
* **~100ms** startup time for simpe demo application worker
* **Under 1s** startup time for real world application cluster with 8 workers
* **Secure** built in authtorisation with cryptographic passwords hashing [bcrypt](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js), [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io) ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) encoding/decoding
* **Simple modular extensible architecture to build complex RPC APIs** code base in production since 2013
* **Request and response data validation** using declarative style api and JSON Schema validator ([ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv))
* **Built-in api auto discovery**
* **Built-in api auto tests (in progress)**
