# Matter In Motion. Serializers

To use [API](https://github.com/matter-in-motion/mm/blob/master/docs/api.md) you should define at least one serializer:

* __[json](https://github.com/matter-in-motion/mm-json)__
* __[msgpack](https://github.com/matter-in-motion/mm-msgpack)__

Install serializer extension as any other Matter in Motion extension:

1. `npm i <extension>`
2. Add extension into extensions list in your settings
3. Add extension settings

__You can use multiple serializers at once.__
